# Performance Improvements
- Analyse why lose bids
- dont bid on single stuff, but general
- medianizer/gasprice
- dxproxy
- Have a look at the Median and the GasPrice update frequency to increase performance and make them dependent on their volatility
    - Move Medianizer.PRICE_UPDATE_INTERVAL to config.properties or make it variable

# Refactoring
- **Add test coverage to Uniswap and Oasis**
- **Fix bug profit provider bug**
- Use Mockito to mock balances and test methods
- Have a look at both uniswap profitable methods, maybe refactor into one?

# Current limitations
- Where do you run it (AWS or Raspberry Pi)?
- How to you connect to the Ethereum Nethwork (Infura or Geth)?
- How do you get price feeds (Need API keys)?

# Open Questions
- Will the new OasisDex contract expire like the last one?

# Others
- write peak total usd balance into java properties and date of it
- redeploy and check for errors/ null pointer exception
- java properties: TOTAL ARBITRAGE P&L, TOTAL MISSED PROFITS, TOTAL P&L DURING EXECUTION    -55.15 USD
- interest wins or loses by compound, can get transaction costs out of transaction receipts and compare in and output of daiUser into compound
- partial redeem of compound
- cdai trading on compound
- examine in and out of compound
